# ðŸŽ® RPC & REST API

## Time to play

Figment has created a Reputation System API to track miner performance on the Filecoin network.

Learn about the APIs available via Filecoin [**DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/) ****below.

## Miner Reputation System API by Figment

The Miner Reputation System API provides users with all of the necessary information for assessing the reputation of storage miners on the Filecoin network.

By tracking storage capacity, sector faults, deals and slashes of every storage miner, the API calculates a reputation score, which can be used by network participants to compare and choose a reliable miner.

Additionally, the API allows users to look up account details (such as balance) or retrieve a list of transactions for an account. It also keeps a history of miner-related events, such as storage capacity changes, sector faults and deal slashes.


The documentation of the API can be found below.

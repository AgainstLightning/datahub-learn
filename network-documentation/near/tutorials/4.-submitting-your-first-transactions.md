# 4. Submit your first transactions

## Introduction

At some point, while building on the NEAR blockchain, you will want to submit transactions in order to unlock the full power of NEAR.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to submit transactions using the NEAR SDK and a [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=near) node.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have completed the tutorials:

1. [Connecting to a NEAR node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/tutorials/1.-connecting-to-a-near-node-using-datahub)
2. [Creating your first NEAR account with the NEAR SDK](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/tutorials/2.-creating-your-first-near-account-using-the-sdk)
3. [Querying the NEAR blockchain](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/tutorials/3.-querying-the-near-blockchain)

We will be building on top of the Nodejs application created in these tutorials.

## Sending Tokens

In the previous tutorials, we created our account and we used the Testnet faucet to request test tokens. Now that we have some tokens to spend, let's send some of them to another account.

Start by creating a new file `transfer.js` in the project directory and add the code below:

```javascript
// Load environment variables
require("dotenv").config();

// Load Near SDK components
const near = require("near-api-js");
const { sha256 } = require("js-sha256");
const fs = require("fs");

// Formatter helper for NEAR amounts
function formatAmount(amount) {
  return BigInt(near.utils.format.parseNearAmount(amount.toString()));
};

// Directory where NEAR credentials are going to be stored
const credentialsPath = "./credentials";

// Configure the keyStore to be used with the SDK
const UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore = near.keyStores.UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore;
const keyStore = new UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore(credentialsPath)

// Setup default client options
const options = {
  networkId:   process.env.NEAR_NETWORK,
  nodeUrl:     process.env.NEAR_NODE_URL,
  walletUrl:   `https://wallet.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  helperUrl:   `https://helper.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  explorerUrl: `https://explorer.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  accountId:   process.env.NEAR_ACCOUNT,
  deps: {
    keyStore: keyStore
  }
}

// Configure transaction details
const txSender = options.accountId;
const txReceiver = "pizza.testnet"; // CHANGE THE RECEIVER
const txAmount = formatAmount(1);

async function main() {
  // Configure the client with options and our local key store
  const client = await near.connect(options);
  const provider = client.connection.provider;

  // Private key configuration
  const keyRootPath = client.connection.signer.keyStore.keyDir;
  const keyFilePath = `${keyRootPath}/${options.networkId}/${options.accountId}.json`;

  // Load key pair from the file
  const content = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(keyFilePath).toString());
  const keyPair = near.KeyPair.fromString(content.private_key);

  // Get the sender public key
  const publicKey = keyPair.getPublicKey();
  console.log("Sender public key:", publicKey.toString())

  // Get the public key information from the node
  const accessKey = await provider.query(
    `access_key/${txSender}/${publicKey.toString()}`, ""
  );
  console.log("Sender access key:", accessKey);

  // Check to make sure provided key is a full access key
  if (accessKey.permission !== "FullAccess") {
    return console.log(`Account [${txSender}] does not have permission to send tokens using key: [${publicKey}]`);
  };

  // Each transaction requires a unique number or nonce
  // This is created by taking the current nonce and incrementing it
  const nonce = ++accessKey.nonce;
  console.log("Calculated nonce:", nonce);

  // Construct actions that will be passed to the createTransaction method below
  const actions = [near.transactions.transfer(txAmount)];

  // Convert a recent block hash into an array of bytes.
  // This is required to prove the tx was recently constructed (within 24hrs)
  const recentBlockHash = near.utils.serialize.base_decode(accessKey.block_hash);

  // Create a new transaction object
  const transaction = near.transactions.createTransaction(
    txSender,
    publicKey,
    txReceiver,
    nonce,
    actions,
    recentBlockHash
  );

  // Before we can sign the transaction we must perform three steps
  // 1) Serialize the transaction in Borsh
  const serializedTx = near.utils.serialize.serialize(
    near.transactions.SCHEMA,
    transaction
  );

  // 2) Hash the serialized transaction using sha256
  const serializedTxHash = new Uint8Array(sha256.array(serializedTx));

  // 3) Create a signature using the hashed transaction
  const signature = keyPair.sign(serializedTxHash);

  // Sign the transaction
  const signedTransaction = new near.transactions.SignedTransaction({
    transaction,
    signature: new near.transactions.Signature({
      keyType: transaction.publicKey.keyType,
      data: signature.signature
    })
  });

  // Send the transaction
  try {
    const result = await provider.sendTransaction(signedTransaction);

    console.log("Creation result:", result.transaction);
    console.log("----------------------------------------------------------------");
    console.log("OPEN LINK BELOW to see transaction in NEAR Explorer!");
    console.log(`${options.explorerUrl}/transactions/${result.transaction.hash}`);
    console.log("----------------------------------------------------------------");

    setTimeout(async function() {
      console.log("Checking transaction status:", result.transaction.hash);

      const status = await provider.sendJsonRpc("tx", [result.transaction.hash, options.accountId]);
      console.log("Transaction status:", status);
    }, 5000);
  }
  catch(error) {
    console.log("ERROR:", error);
  }
};

main()
```

Don't forget to set a unique`NEAR_ACCOUNT` name in your .env file!
{% endhint %}

Let's break this down a bit. At the top, as usual, we import NEAR SDK and `dotenv`. Everything looks the same but we have an extra package in use this time: `js-sha256`. We'll be using it to produce SHA256 hashes of our transactions.

Next, we load our account key into the key store to be used with NEAR client, just like we did in Tutorial \#2 \(Creating Accounts\), no changes here.

```javascript
content = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(keyFilePath).toString());
keyPair = near.KeyPair.fromString(content.private_key);
```

Before we can create a transaction we will need to [**fetch the access key**](https://docs.near.org/docs/api/rpc#view-access-key) for our account. To sign a token transfer transaction we need a sender's key with`FullAccess` permission that we're going to use during transaction construction. Access key fetching is done by calling the `query` method:

```javascript
publicKey = keyPair.getPublicKey();
accessKey = await provider.query(`access_key/ACCOUNT_ID/${publicKey.toString()}`, "")
```

Each transaction must include a unique number, a nonce, which we can obtain from the `accessKey`. We must increment the number to make it valid, the transaction will be rejected if it's assigned an existing nonce value.

```javascript
nonce = accessKey.nonce + 1
```

Transactions in NEAR could have multiple actions encoded in them \(unlike other blockchains\) which is useful for batch processing on the network. Since we're doing a simple token transfer we'll use the `Transfer` action. When sending NEAR tokens during a transaction, the amount needs to be converted into Yocto â“ƒ or \(10^-24\) with `formatAmount` helper method.

```javascript
txAmount = formatAmount(1); // => 1000000000000000000000000
actions = [near.transactions.transfer(txAmount)];
```

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: use the helper methods to format amount to avoid sending different amounts than intended ðŸ˜‰
{% endhint %}

Onto construction: SDK provides a `createTransaction` method to build the transaction object. The arguments are pretty self-explanatory with an exception of the last argument - it's a recent block hash data required to prove the transaction was recently constructed, typically within 24 hours.

```javascript
transaction = near.transactions.createTransaction(
  txSender,   // sender account name
  publicKey,  // sender public key
  txReceiver, // receiver account name
  nonce,      // tx nonce
  actions,    // tx actions
  near.utils.serialize.base_decode(accessKey.block_hash);
);
```

Before we can sign our transaction we must serialize it using NEAR's serialization format \(BORSH\), then create a transaction hash signature and finally sign the transaction with our public key.

```javascript
serializedTxHash = new Uint8Array(sha256.array(serializedTx));

signedTransaction = new near.transactions.SignedTransaction({
  transaction,
  signature: new near.transactions.Signature({
    keyType: transaction.publicKey.keyType,
    data: keyPair.sign(serializedTxHash).signature
  })
});
```

Our transaction is ready to be sent to NEAR. Broadcasting the transaction means that it will be sent to the node but we will not receive a response immediately. It will take some time for the validators to validate our transaction and add it to the block. Luckily, NEAR network is fast enough that we can get the transaction confirmed within a few seconds.

```javascript
result = await provider.sendTransaction(signedTransaction);
```

## Wrap up

Let's run the code:

```javascript
node transfer.js
```

If everything works right \(you have enough tokens, recipient exists, etc\) you should see an output similar to:

```javascript
Sender public key: ed25519:2EkrpVXEbFmg8T6UZkCv8JBfjJyGMUgsfdh7mcuShwxf
Sender access key: { nonce: 3,
  permission: 'FullAccess',
  block_height: 23170143,
  block_hash: 'HwYKA1LnZE6YiSwc2WvvQKBnBFuMnhyza4XKbUUnPRtW' }
Calculated nonce: 4
Creation result: { signer_id: 'figment-learn.testnet',
  public_key: 'ed25519:2EkrpVXEbFmg8T6UZkCv8JBfjJyGMUgsfdh7mcuShwxf',
  nonce: 4,
  receiver_id: 'pizza.testnet',
  actions: [ { Transfer: [Object] } ],
  signature:
   'ed25519:8L7p4vVe5cD9YRYrvpQotVyjULreGQCNfZTCm96jLNRD7uXtVYsRZtHYMGG2sw44ZVjjFqKzjqD7gEA9V4FzZq7',
  hash: 'FL8Q5JZ3mKsV8HE8GBDUzmHbNkv1P3cNT3eb7bEym11B' }
----------------------------------------------------------------
OPEN LINK BELOW to see transaction in NEAR Explorer!
https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/FL8Q5JZ3mKsV8HE8GBDUzmHbNkv1P3cNT3eb7bEym11B
----------------------------------------------------------------
```

Congratulations! You have just submitted your first transaction to the NEAR Testnet network using a DataHub node. Now it's time to check if the transaction was successful by checking its status:

```javascript
status = await provider.sendJsonRpc("tx", [result.transaction.hash, options.accountId]);
```

The output might look similar to:

```javascript
{ status: { SuccessValue: '' },
  transaction:
   { signer_id: 'figment-learn.testnet',
     public_key: 'ed25519:2EkrpVXEbFmg8T6UZkCv8JBfjJyGMUgsfdh7mcuShwxf',
     nonce: 8,
     receiver_id: 'pizza.testnet',
     actions: [ [Object] ],
     signature:
      'ed25519:8wfoeTNhbfgr2LpSmYoVgyQuH84t14c5i1QMWPBSFHK4zYq72mitg5FvtjdX6rvHes3cBKBB1g8S23jXaYbf1Ft',
     hash: 'CMx3FRFqV6QWzvyH1cBjRgNaZPboDvaCk7upCjGB7usp' },
  transaction_outcome:
   { proof: [],
     block_hash: 'Gtyh2uomBtcNQ4BJ7qH333boPRmp4yVBB2NmHYJjXbxF',
     id: 'CMx3FRFqV6QWzvyH1cBjRgNaZPboDvaCk7upCjGB7usp',
     outcome:
      { logs: [],
        receipt_ids: [Array],
        gas_burnt: 223182562500,
        tokens_burnt: '22318256250000000000',
        executor_id: 'figment-learn.testnet',
        status: [Object] } },
  receipts_outcome:
   [ { proof: [],
       block_hash: '8hEaShbj8LHcpXTKZKHv31u7nhvsbRjap8KhSfSkE2zx',
       id: 'G1nfacWJBn3jtzJUN4eNu2nvr8aAEcMnKQ2tsnbyNEVX',
       outcome: [Object] },
     { proof: [],
       block_hash: 'D7iGmDS6qsAmXyxyBriZqRwWUwWqFHryEo14mMDws8x4',
       id: '13Nf8yRSf7bhDQLM65n5pvjtfFXfhPuYnXvBwTqcDpKX',
       outcome: [Object] } ] }
```

We can also check by going to the NEAR Explorer link included in the output before

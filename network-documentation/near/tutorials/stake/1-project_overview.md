# Show Me the Money: Learn How to Monetize NEAR Smart Contracts

I invite you to join me In this tutorial series and learn how to design, build, and monetize smart contracts on the NEAR 
platform. Learning is fun, applying what you learn to build is more fun, and making money from what you have built is rewarding. 
I believe in the philosophy of the "proof is in the pudding". In this tutorial series we will be building a real world
smart contract called the [STAKE](https://github.com/oysterpack/oysterpack-near-stake-token) token. The project is open
source and the community is invited and welcomed to participate. My goals for this tutorial series are:
1. share with you my approach to architect, design, and code smart contracts in Rust
2. take you step by step through designing, building, and testing the STAKE token
3. share with you design patterns I have learned while working on the STAKE token project
4. show you how you can monetize your smart contracts using the STAKE token

## NEAR Technology + Economics = Game Changer
> It's the economy, stupid ...

When I first discovered NEAR, what caught my attention was NEAR's economic model. It is well thought out and designed to
provide economic incentive and value. Couple that with NEAR's scalable sharded technology and speed, and you have a platform
that can deliver real world business and economic value. NEAR has the potential and all the key ingredients to become the 
first true economical decentralized cloud platform - to compete with centralized cloud platforms owned by a few big tech
companies ...

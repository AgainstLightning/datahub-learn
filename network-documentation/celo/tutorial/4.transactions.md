# 4. Submitting transactions
## Introduction
It’s time to submit your first transactions. In this tutorial we will connect to Celo node hosted by DataHub and we will:
* transfer our testnet tokens
* exchange tokens
* stake tokens

## Prerequisites
Please make sure that you completed tutorial:
* 1. Connecting to Celo node with DataHub
* 2. Creating your first Celo account
* 3. Query the Celo Network

We will be building on top of the NodeJS application you created in the previous tutorials.

## Transfer tokens
As you remember from previous tutorials, we funded our account on Alfajores testnet with `5CELO` and `10cUSD`. Now let’s try to transfer those tokens to another test account.

Create file `transfers.js` and with the following snippet:

```javascript
const { newKit } = require('@celo/contractkit');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Celo Network node
  const client = newKit(process.env.REST_URL);
  const web3 = client.web3;

  // Initialize account from our private key
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

  // We need to add address to ContractKit in order to sign transactions
  client.addAccount(account.privateKey);

  // Specify recipient Address
  const recipientAddress = '0xD86518b29BB52a5DAC5991eACf09481CE4B0710d'

  // Specify an amount to send
  const amount = 100000

  // Get contract wrappers
  const goldtoken = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken()
  const stabletoken = await kit.contracts.getStableToken()

  // Transfer CELO and cUSD from your account to anAddress
  // Specify cUSD as the feeCurrency when sending cUSD
  const celotx = await goldtoken.transfer(recipientAddress, amount).send({from: account.address})
  const cUSDtx = await stabletoken.transfer(recipientAddress, amount).send({from: account.address, feeCurrency: stabletoken.address})

  // Wait for the transactions to be processed
  const celoReceipt = await celotx.waitReceipt()
  const cUSDReceipt = await cUSDtx.waitReceipt()

  // Print receipts
  console.log('CELO Transaction receipt:', celoReceipt)
  console.log('cUSD Transaction receipt:', cUSDReceipt)
};
```

Ok, let’s break it down.
After we initialize account from private key, we need to add account to ContractKit  in order to be able to sign transactions. The we specify recipient’s address and amount we want to transfer. In this case we will be transferring `100000 base CELO units` to address `0xD86518b29BB52a5DAC5991eACf09481CE4B0710d`. 
Here you can notice that we mentioned base units of CELO. Since Javascript does not have floating point numbers, it is common to convert integers to large numbers (BigNumber) before doing arithmetic. In case of Celo, 1 CELO = 1018 base units of CELO.
What is interesting about above code is that we don’t call transfer method directly on the ContractKit client. Instead we first, get contract wrappers. Celo has a number of core Smart Contracts that are deployed to the network. In this example. we use GoldToken and StableToken contract wrappers, which both have `transfer` function allowing us to build transfer transaction. Here we build transfer transaction to the same account the same amount of CELO and cUSD. Don’t forget to call `send` method, which takes transfer transaction and broadcasts it to Celo Alfajores network.
Since transactions may take some time to be process we need to wait for the response. In order to do that we use `waitReceipt` method:

```javascript
const celoReceipt = await celotx.waitReceipt()
const cUSDReceipt = await cUSDtx.waitReceipt()
```

Let’s run this script:

```bash
node transfer.js
```

If all went well, you should see a transaction receipt printed in the console.  You can copy transactionHash and paste it in [Alfajores Explorer - BlockScout](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/txs).

## Exchange tokens
With ContractKit you can always exchange your cUSD to CELO and the other way around. Let’s see how we can do that.

Create a file called `exchange.js` with the following snippet:

```javascript
const { newKit } = require('@celo/contractkit');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Celo Network node
  const client = newKit(process.env.REST_URL);
  const web3 = client.web3;

  // Initialize account from our private key
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

  // We need to add address to ContractKit in order to sign transactions
  client.addAccount(account.privateKey);

  // Get contract wrappers
  const stableToken = await client.contracts.getStableToken()
  const exchange = await client.contracts.getExchange()

  // Get cUSD balance
  const cUsdBalance = await stableToken.balanceOf(account.address)

  // Approve a user to transfer StableToken on behalf of another user.
  const approveTx = await stableToken.approve(exchange.address, cUsdBalance).send({from: account.address});
  const approveReceipt = await approveTx.waitReceipt();

  // Exchange cUSD for CELO
  const goldAmount = await exchange.quoteUsdSell(cUsdBalance);
  const sellTx = await exchange.sellDollar(cUsdBalance, goldAmount).send({from: account.address})
  const sellReceipt = await sellTx.waitReceipt()

  // Print receipts
  console.log('Approve Transaction receipt:', approveReceipt)
  console.log('Sell Transaction receipt:', sellReceipt)
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});

```

In this snippet you can see that we will be using not only `StableToken` contract wrapper but also `Exchange`. This Smart Contract is responsible for exchanging tokens.
First we get amount to cUSD that we own by calling `balanceOf`. Then we have to approve Exchange Smart Contract address to be able to exchange tokens in our behalf. Once we have this out of our way, we can call `quoteUsdSell` method in order to get amount of CELO we will receive for our cUSD and finally call `sellDollar` to perform exchange of tokens.

OK, now let’s run the script:

```bash
node exchange.js
```

Congratulations! You’ve successfully exchanged cUSD to CELO. 

## Conclusion
In this tutorial we’ve learn how to submit transactions to Celo network using DataHub and ContractKit. In order to do that we used many different Smart Contracts such as: StableToken,  GoldToken and Exchange. For more comprehensive list of available wrappers you can go to  [Celo documentation](https://docs.celo.org/v/master/developer-guide/contractkit/contracts-wrappers-registry).

## Next Steps
We know how to query Celo network and how to submit transactions. So far we used only core Celo Smart Contracts. Now it’s time to deploy our own Smart Contract and interact with it.

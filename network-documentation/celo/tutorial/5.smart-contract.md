# 5. Deploying and interacting with custom smart contract
## Introduction
In this tutorial we will create, deploy and interact with our own Smart Contract on the Celo network. As we’ve mentioned in previous tutorials, Celo is a close cousin of Ethereum, which means we have Ethereum's rich developer ecosystem and tooling at our disposal. We will be deploying a simple hello world smart contract to the Alfajores testnet using Datahub, Truffle and Ganache.

## Prerequisites
Since Celo runs the Ethereum Virtual Machine, we can use Truffle to compile our smart contract.
First step is to make sure that you have truffle installed:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

## Creating project
Since this tutorial is a little bit more involved, we will be creating a new NodeJS project for it. 

Truffle comes with bare project templates which are called boxes. They are used to speed up the development process. Since this is not a tutorial about writing Solidity smart contracts, we will use Metacoin box in this tutorial. This box contains a simple smart contract for sending and receiving tokens.

In the project root directory, run the following command:

```bash
truffle unbox metacoin
```

Once this command is done executing, you will have a project with the following items:
* **contracts/** - directory where you keep Solidity contracts
* **migrations/** - directory for scriptable deployment files
* **test/** - directory for test files
* **truffle-config.js** - configuration file

## Setup project
Now open truffle-config.js and replace the content of this file with the following snippet:

```javascript
const { newKit } = require('@celo/contractkit');

require('dotenv').config();

let client;

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Celo Network node
  client = newKit(process.env.REST_URL);

  // Initialize account from our private key
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

  // We need to add address to ContractKit in order to sign transactions
  client.addAccount(account.privateKey);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    test: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    },
    alfajores: {
      provider: client.connection.web3.currentProvider, // CeloProvider
      network_id: 44787  // latest Alfajores network id
    }
  }
};
```

This instructs Truffle to use two networks: test, and Alfajores.

## Compile the smart contract

Before we can deploy the contract to the Celo network, we need to first compile the Solidity code into Ethereum bytcode. In order to do that we need to run:

```
truffle compile
```

After this command is done running, you should see a new `build` folder inside of your project, which contains a bunch of JSON files. Please do not edit those JSON files as they are required by Truffle to work correctly.

## Deploy the smart contract

There are 2 ways to deploy your smart contract. We could use Truffle to do so or we could submit an on-chain transaction which will deploy the smart contract. We will go with the later for the purpose of this tutorial.

Create a file `deployment.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const { newKit } = require('@celo/contractkit');
const MetaCoin = require('./build/contracts/MetaCoin.json')

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Celo Network node
  const client = newKit(process.env.REST_URL);
  const web3 = client.web3;

  // Initialize account from our private key
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

  // We need to add address to ContractKit in order to sign transactions
  client.addAccount(account.privateKey);

  // Create deployment transaction
  let tx = await client.connection.sendTransaction({
    from: account.address,
    data: MetaCoin.bytecode
  })

  // Wait for transaction to be processed
  const receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();

  console.log('Send deploy transaction receipt:', receipt);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

If you’ve completed the previous tutorials this code should look familiar. There are two things worth noting here:
* At the top of the file we import `MetaCoin.json` which is a build artefact after running `truffle compile`
* After we add our account to ContractKit we call `sentTransaction` passing in `MetaCoin.bytecode` as data attribute.

Now we are ready to run this script:

```bash
node deployment.js
```

If everything goes right, this should deploy your MetaCoin smart contract to the Celo Alfajores testnet using DataHub. In the output of this command you should find a transaction hash, which you can use to lookup transaction on [Alfajores Celo Explorer](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/).

## Interacting with your smart contract

Now that our MetaCoin smart contract has been deployed it is time to interact with it.

Let’s create a new file `interactions.js` with following content:

```javascript
const { newKit } = require('@celo/contractkit');
const MetaCoin = require('./build/contracts/MetaCoin.json')

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Celo Network node
  const client = newKit(process.env.REST_URL);
  const web3 = client.web3;

  // Initialize account from our private key
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

  // We need to add address to ContractKit in order to sign transactions
  client.addAccount(account.privateKey);

  // Check the Celo network ID
  const networkId = await web3.eth.net.getId()

  // Get the contract associated with the current network
  const deployedNetwork = MetaCoin.networks[networkId]

  // Create a new contract instance with the MetaCoin contract info
  let instance = new web3.eth.Contract(
    MetaCoin.abi,
    deployedNetwork && deployedNetwork.address
  );

  // Get balance
  let balanceBefore = await instance.methods.getBalance(account.address).call();
  console.log('Balance before:', balanceBefore);

  // Send tokens
  const recipientAddress = '0xD86518b29BB52a5DAC5991eACf09481CE4B0710d'
  const amount = 100

  const txObject = await instance.methods.sendCoin(recipientAddress, amount);
  let tx = await kit.sendTransactionObject(txObject, { from: account.address });

  let receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();
  console.log('Sent coin smart contract call receipt: ', receipt);

  // Get balance again
  let balanceAfter = await instance.methods.getBalance(account.address).call();
  console.log('Balance after:', balanceAfter);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

There is lot going on here so let’s break it down a little bit.

After initializing ContractKit and adding our account to it, we have to create a new contract instance using smart contract ABI and the address of the network this smart contract has been deployed to. Once this is done, we can call the `getBalance` method of our smart contract. This call should output `Balance before: 10000` as this is the initial amount assigned to our address.

Next step is to send `100` tokens to a different address. Here we first create a transaction object and then send it to the Celo Alfajores node for processing. Once this transaction is completed we call `getBalance` to check if our balance has been updated. If all went well the output should read `Balance after: 9900`.

Congratulations! You’ve just interacted with your own instance of a smart contract deployed to the Celo Alfajores testnet.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial we learned quite a lot! We took a quick look at one of the Ethereum’s most powerful development tool - Truffle. We used it to compile our smart contract. Then we deployed our smart contract with few lines of Javascript code and called two methods on that smart contract. 

We have only covered a very small area of contract development. We invite you to keep experimenting on your own, and we will be providing more advanced Celo tutorials shortly to help you get to the next level.

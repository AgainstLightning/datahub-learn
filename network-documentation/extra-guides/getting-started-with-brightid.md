# Getting started with BrightID

## **1. What is BrightID and how to install it?**

BrightID lets apps make sure their users don't have multiple accounts so that everyone has a fair share and a better experience. Each person has an account on BrightID and makes connections with people they know. A graph is formed with the accounts and their connections and fake accounts are detected by analyzing the graph. BrightID is a stepping stone to create a fair digital world for all citizens of the world.

Unlike other ID verification tools, BrightID requires no ID number, date of birth, or proof of address. All you need to provide is a picture and a name of your choice to facilitate making connections and other activities. You can even change them at any time.

Your name and picture are saved only on your own device and nowhere else on the internet. You share them securely via a p2p channel when you make connections with your friends. The home screen shows your name and picture. Your BrightID status is indicated under your name as either verified or unverified. A badge appears next to your name when you get verified.

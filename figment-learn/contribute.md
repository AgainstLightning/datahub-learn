### **What is Share to Earn and why should I contribute?** 

Share to Earn is a program that supports people who create content for the Web 3 Knowledge Base. Through the program, community authors receive a personal payout in tokens and get to showcase their knowledge and skills to the community. The work of these community authors helps grow DataHub's library of Web 3 tutorials and benefits the entire ecosystem. 

### What is the payout structure? 

Authors are paid in the tokens of the protocol they write about, which allows us to align their incentives with the growth of the network's userbase. New tutorials are paid between $300 and $500 in token equivalent, while complex production-focused updates for existing tutorials are typically paid $100 in token equivalent. All payouts are at editorial discretion. 

### What is the publication process? 

1. **Apply:** Apply to the program with your topic idea and we will get in touch to review your qualifications. We publish only original, first-run content that brings value to the community  
2. **Collaborate:** If you're accepted, you'll work with the editorial team to refine your topic and outline for your tutorial 
3. **Write:** Once your topic is approved, it's time to write  
4. **Revise:** Submit your first draft and collaborate one-on-one with one of our editors to revise your work  
5. **Publish:** After revisions, your editor will send your payment, publish your article, and ask what you want to write about next. Figment will also promote your article across all of our social networks and you will be identified as the author in the knowledge base 

###  What should I write about? 

At a high level we are looking for two categories of tutorials

* **Connecting Web 2 & Web 3:** For Web3 to be adopted widely, we'll need to bridge its technology with platforms and languages that are popular in Web2 development today. Tutorials inspire developers to build DApps in their favorite languages and architect their DApps the way they are used to.  
* **Project-specific walkthroughs:** We need to leverage the open-nature of Web3 development to collaborate and iterate on existing projects to quickly increase their UX and performance. Tutorials providing a guide to build necessary infrastructures such as wallets, payment apps, and exchanges are welcomed.
